# Cross browser testing

In this project I have implemented the selenium grid tests running on Chrome and firefox with the help of Docker containerization.

#Docker
This can be used either with Docker commands 

or 

#Docker-compose
This can be also used with docker-compose to run the tests without having to pull any images and other docker commands.
